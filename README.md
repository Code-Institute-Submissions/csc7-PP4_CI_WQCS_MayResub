# **2 . User Experience**

UX has been addressed (and remains as a constant activity) around Jesse James Garrett's process, whose five planes involves the following matters:
- **STRATEGY**: to build a website (product) that creates wavelet signals and gives the option to contact the developer.
- **SCOPE**: the minimum viable product needs to include features that allow the user to know the following:
    - Basic information about the about the functions being implemented (wavelet formulas).
    - A graph of the wavelet, using Google Charts (please see credit below), based on input parameters given by the user.
    - A section where user can input the type of wavelet, sampling rate, length of the signal and its frequency.
    - A "Generate" button.
    - An "Export" button.
    - A quiz with ten questions.
    - A contact form.
- **STRUCTURE**: the information is structured as follows:
    - Wavelet functions, in a separate page called "Functions".
    - Google Chart (please see credit below) graph, input parameters and generate/export buttons in a separate page called "Generator".
    - A quiz with ten questions in a separate page called "Quiz".
    - A contact form in a separate page called "Contact".
    - A fixed navigation bar on top.
    - A fixed footer.
- **SKELETON**: the information is accessed through a fixed navigation menu on top of the pages.
- **SURFACE**: the website is based on red, white and blue colours to give strong contrast and simultaneously a "live" design.

## **User Goals**
- To find an interactive website.
- To navigate through a responsive website.
- To have ...
- To select ...
- To export ...
- To check ...
- To be able to contact the developer if desired.

14. As a returning user, I want to have a way to contact the developer so I can contribute and/or indicate errors or bugs.

- ### **Site Owner**
15. As owner, I want to create a website that provides a basic ... so users can use it to ...
16. As owner, I want to create a website that is the base for further development, so I can keep showing my work and offer more solutions in the future.
17. As owner, along with other points of this section, I want to show my work and give the option to users to contact me if they wish.
18. As owner, I want to provide a website that can be browsed fully without using the back button, so users have a "map" of the website at all times and do not get issues while navigating (like sending data to a server interrupted or resent).
19. As owner, I want to provide a responsive website, so user can access it from any device without any constraint to navigate, find and/or use the website.
20. As owner, I want to give an interactive website that update colours, graphs and information, so users enjoy the navigation on the website and instantly know if the website works properly or it does not.
21. As owner, I want to put a brand in the top left, so users not only associate the brand with the website but also they can click it for the "home" (Functions) page.

# **3 . Design Choices**

The design was planned to cover screen sizes from 320x568px to 1920x1370px.

## **Colours**
Red, white (as background) and blue is the base of the website. The goal is to provide strong contrast and use colours that show a vivid website.

#### [Back to Index](#index)
<br>

## **Fonts**
Google fonts (please see credits section below) were implemented on the website. Nunito/Montserrat were selected as the font pair for the website (following Google's suggestion), however only Nunito has been applied.
Sans-serif font is used as a back-up in case the previous font cannot be loaded.

Colour #rgb(98, 98, 161), dark blue, was selected for paragraphs, while red and blue for headings.

#### [Back to Index](#index)
<br>

## **Structure**
The metadata includes the following keywords to help search engines to find the website: ..., Code Institute, software development, student, full-stack course, milestone project.

The visible website is organised in a header, a body and a footer.

Wireframes were developed at the beginning in order to have a first design of the website.

- ### **Header**

In order to achieve the goals related to easiness and/or simplicity, a fixed navigation area in the header is provided. In the same area, a logo with the idea of the website is place to the left.
The header contains the navigation bar with the four links to the body pages (please see next section).

- ### **Body**

The body of the pages are structured as follows for each of the pages:
- #### *Instructions:*
    It contains a ...
- #### *Weather:*
    It has ...
- #### *Incidence Blog:*
    It contains ...
- #### *Contact:*
    It has a simple contact form, centre-aligned, with name, surname, e-mail and description fields, before it finds the send button.
<br>
    
- ### **Footer**

The footer contains links for social media (LinkedIn and GitHub) and e-mail. It is designed to remain fixed at the bottom of the webpages in order to have the links always visible to promote the developer of the website.\

# 9 . Bugs

Some bugs were related to positioning of elements in the page. They were fixed by assigning proper values, most of them with the help of a temporary background colour for the element.

Then, many minor bugs were solved just by assigning the correct property and/or by trial and error.

Bugs that required more time and specific solutions were the following ones:

| Bug | Solution |
| ---- | ---- |
| The ... | The issue was caused ... Solved with **Therefore**... |

# 10 . Deployment

The website was fully written in Gitpod, permanently tested with Gitpod preview, and periodically deployed to GigHub Pages (in a main branch).

The fully deployed website, accessible by anyone, is found [here](https://csc7.github.io/PP2_CI_WW), whose URL is https://csc7.github.io/PP2_CI_WW . Its repository is found [here](https://github.com/csc7/PP4_CI_WQCS), whose URL is https://github.com/csc7/PP2_CI_WW.

Based on the Code Institute's Love Running project content, the following steps has been applied to have the front-end final version deployed:
1. Select website repository in GitHub account.
2. Go to "Settings" (up in the menu, to the right).
3. Select "Pages" in the menu on the left.
4. At the beginning, in "Source", select "Branch: main", and click "Save".
5. The URL address of the deployed website will appear on top of the page, as can be observed in the screenshot below in the drop-down item.

<details>
    <summary>GitHub Pages Screenshot</summary>

![Deployment on GitHub Pages Image](docs/GitHub-Pages.PNG) 
</details>

\
After first deployment, several updates have been carried out before the final version. These updates were implemented in the deployed website from Gitpod, just by using the "push" command for every commit (change) in the ongoing development.

The project can also be forked from the repository (https://github.com/csc7/PP2_CI_WW), please check for the "Fork" button, top-right of the page, to achieve this task.
